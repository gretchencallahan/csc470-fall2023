There are some errors with the build but i'm not sure why they're happening.

For example:
- when the main character collides with a car it doesn't end the game
- The function to generate new sections of the game doesn't do what it's supposed to

I don't know why some of these things aren't working. The code seems perfectly fine so I don't get what's wrong
